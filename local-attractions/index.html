<h1>Local Attractions</h1>
<p>“Living in the area for 40 years, i have my favourites. The drive into Bamburgh and the imposing castle looms large. Coldingham bay to the north with its quaint painted beach huts, followed by fish and chips in the lovely Eyemouth. A brisk walk around the Berwick town ramparts after a hearty breakfast is a must, or along the pier to the lighthouse. A quiet round of golf at the Hirsel, dubbed the ‘Augusta of the north’or Goswick for the purists. Fantastic beaches, great people. Whatever you want, you can find it in North Northumberland and the Borders.” – <strong>Steven (CEO, East Coast Rental LTD)</strong></p>
