<p>
  <strong>East Coast Rental Ltd is a family business that provides a personal bespoke car hire service based on a commitment to high quality customer care. Aiming for a more personal and accessible car hire experience, the business also hopes to attract more tourists to the local area.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Background history</strong></p>

<p>
  Steven Scott heads up the business and started the company after spotting a gap in the car hire market. Stevenâ€™s experience was in the retail motor trade but after suffering negative experiences with global car hire firms himself he decided to set up the business with company secretary Tom Robson and partner Vicki Scott, technical support provide by Scott Robertson.

<p><strong>The business offer</strong></p>

<p>
  East Coast Rental Ltd differentiates itself from the rest of the market by offering flexible working hours during the summer months and so provides a tailored service to meet customer needs.
</p>

<p>
  Many customers arrive by train so the company builds relationships with them at an early stage in the process so as to fully understand their needs and tailor a bespoke package appropriately. This approach makes the transfer from train to car as seamless as possible, so enhancing the customer journey both literally and metaphorically.
</p>

<p>
  Local businesses and individuals also benefit from the ethos of putting the customer at the heart of the service and local suppliers are used for vehicle purchasing, servicing, valeting and for marketing and advertising too.
